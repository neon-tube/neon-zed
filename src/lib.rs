//! Zed extension glue for Neon.
//!
//! The only job here is producing the command that starts `neon-lsp`. What the server can
//! do is not declared anywhere in this extension -- not here and not in `extension.toml`.
//! Zed reads it from the `initialize` response, so the ten capabilities in the
//! `ServerCapabilities` literal at the top of `lsp/src/main.rs` reach the editor without
//! passing through this crate at all.
//!
//! This doc comment used to say "it is two things: diagnostics and document formatting",
//! which was both a duplicate of that list and, by the time anyone read it, wrong.
//!
//! The one piece of real logic is `NEON_SYSROOT`. Without it the server still starts, but
//! `load_stdlib` in `lsp/src/main.rs` returns nothing and the checker is skipped entirely,
//! so the editor silently shows only lexer and parser errors. That failure is invisible
//! from inside Zed -- the server looks healthy -- so this resolves the sysroot eagerly and
//! from the most specific source available.
